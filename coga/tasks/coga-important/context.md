## Description

This ticket is the unit of work to build a context block that describes how we
plan to handle important notifications and who's responsible for acting on them.
It's also meant to explain how it differs from coga-flow.

The deliverable is the context block itself — the routing convention any script
can follow to raise a human-action notification. The channel already exists; its
webhook and the coga.toml recipient field are separate tickets.

## coga-important

1. `coga-important` is our Slack channel strictly for notifications that need
   human action.

2. Coga's automatic state-transition broadcasts (create / bump / mark) stay in
   coga-flow.

3. We don't want to be inundated with notifications, but we don't want anything
   to fall through the cracks.

4. Notifications land here automatically — any script that detects an
   action-needed event runs `coga slack --important` to post it to
   `coga-important` (e.g. a patent sweep posting "maintenance fee due").

5. By default every `--important` notification @'s the user set in the coga.toml
   property field — the triage owner it all lands on.

6. That user either handles it, @'s someone in the Slack thread, or opens a ticket
   if it's real work.

7. Handing off stays a plain Slack @ and gets no Coga machinery — a thread reply
   keeps the alert's context, while a second `coga slack` post would land
   disconnected from it and add the channel noise point 3 rules out.

## What changed

New context `coga/important` — the ticket's seven points rewritten as domain
knowledge. Two byte-identical copies:

- `coga/contexts/coga/important/SKILL.md` (live)
- `src/coga/resources/templates/coga/bootstrap/contexts/coga/important/SKILL.md` (packaged)
- `tests/test_packaging.py` — registers the packaged copy in
  `EXPECTED_BOOTSTRAP_RESOURCES` and the pair in `IDENTICAL_LIVE_PACKAGED_PAIRS`.

The ticket body's `## coga-important` points are left untouched:
`add-toml-property-for-notification-recipient` cites "point 5" by number, so
renumbering or deleting them would break that reference.

## Decisions

Packaged, not live-only. `bootstrap/contexts/` resolves at runtime for every
repo (`paths.py:91`, local-first then bundled), so shipping it there is what
lets the patents repo — `--important`'s first consumer per
`add-coga-slack-important` — read the convention without a local copy.
`coga/sync`, the adjacent notification context, is packaged the same way and is
the precedent. The cost: this becomes shipped OS knowledge, and point 1's "*our*
Slack channel" phrasing is team-specific. Reworded as convention rather than as
this team's channel. Flagged for the owner at review; live-only is a one-line
revert of the packaged copy plus its two test entries.

Own section on the blocker boundary. A blocker needs a human but is not an
`--important` post — `coga block` posts through the normal owner path
(`commands/block.py:52-66`, no important flag). Verified in source rather than
assumed, because it is the first question a reader hits: the distinction is that
an alert has no ticket, while a blocker is already attached to one.

Separate context rather than a section in `coga/sync`. `coga/sync` is 606 lines
already, and the `_template` rule is to split at a page.

## Verification

- `python -m pytest tests/test_packaging.py tests/test_paths.py` — 10 passed.
- `coga validate --json` — no new findings (pre-existing idle-task warns only).
- Drove `resolve_context_path(cfg, 'coga/important')` with the worktree's own
  `src` on `PYTHONPATH`: resolves to the live copy, bundled twin exists for the
  no-local-copy case.
- Drove `compose_prompt` with `contexts: ['coga/important']`: the context inlines
  (14331 chars). Confirmed via the heading "The bar, and why it holds", which is
  absent from the ticket body — so the text is coming from the context file and
  not from the ticket. A naive substring probe would have passed either way.

## Notes

The context documents `coga slack --important` and
`[notification.slack].important_recipient`. Neither is on `main` yet:
`--important` is on PR #553 (`support-second-webhook`, at step 4 review) and
`important_recipient` is unimplemented in
`add-toml-property-for-notification-recipient`. This is expected — the ticket
scopes this to the convention and the webhook/recipient work to siblings — but
the context describes the intended end state, so it reads slightly ahead of main
until those two land. Worth a sequencing check at review if the merge order
matters.

## Peer review

Reviewed the authored diff against `main...HEAD`: the feature change is scoped
to the new live context, the packaged copy, and the packaging test allowlist.
The apparent `coga/log.md` / task-state churn in `git diff main -- '*.md'`
comes from `main` advancing after the feature branch forked; the branch's own
two commits do not edit those files.

Applied commit `c4ac259d` (`peer-review: tighten important context accuracy`)
with two must-fix doc corrections:

- Replaced the claim that create/bump/mark state-transition broadcasts stay in
  coga-flow. `coga/sync` and source show routine lifecycle churn is mostly
  silent, explicit FYIs / urgent exceptions are live, and outcomes digest; the
  important rule is that none of that becomes an important alert.
- Replaced the present-tense
  `[notification.slack].important_recipient` / `see coga/sync` wording. That
  key is still sibling-owned and not documented in `coga/sync` on this branch,
  so the context now names it as the planned important-recipient config work
  until that implementation lands.

Spot checks:

- `important-webhook` has `coga slack --important`, `post(..., important=True)`,
  and `SlackChannel.webhook_for(important=)`; this branch does not, matching the
  sibling-ticket sequencing note.
- `important_recipient` does not exist on `main`, `important-context`, or
  `important-webhook` except in task/context planning notes.
- `coga block` posts through the normal `post(...)` path with no important flag.
- `resolve_context_path` resolves local contexts first, then packaged
  `bootstrap/contexts`, so the packaged copy is the right surface for reusable
  Coga OS knowledge.

Peer-review verification:

- `cmp -s coga/contexts/coga/important/SKILL.md src/coga/resources/templates/coga/bootstrap/contexts/coga/important/SKILL.md`
  — passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_packaging.py tests/test_paths.py` — 10 passed;
  pytest warned that the sandbox could not write `.pytest_cache`.
- `git diff --check main...HEAD` — passed.
- `coga validate --json` — still exits non-zero in both the feature worktree and
  primary checkout due to pre-existing repo issues, including missing-step
  errors on `v2/autotrigger-ticket-type`,
  `v2/split-context-to-doc-user-accessible-and-editable`, and
  `v2/use-worktree-when-starting-a-dev-task`.
