## Description

Update every clean remotely managed GitHub/URL skill in one reviewable PR.

Imported skills live as plain directories under `coga/skills/`. GitHub-backed
installs are tracked by `gh skill`'s own metadata. URL-installed skills instead
carry Coga's `.coga-source.json` provenance with `source_type = "url"`.
`coga skill install-local` is a third supported installation path: `gh skill`
records `local-path`, but its updater skips that directory because it has no
GitHub source metadata, and Coga's URL updater does not consume it. Hand-vendored
packs likewise have no managed update source. A freshly initialized repo
attempts to install the optional GitHub refs declared in `managed-skills.toml`,
but installation may be skipped or fail and operators may add any source shape
later. Once a week this ticket fires on its schedule and its `ticket.py` runs
`coga skill update --all --pr`, which:

1. delegates the installed GitHub-backed skills to `gh skill update --dir
   coga/skills --all`, then walks in Coga's own code every skill carrying
   `.coga-source.json` with `source_type = "url"`; local-backed and
   hand-vendored directories are outside both updater paths,
2. for URL-backed skills, rewrites in place only when the upstream digest
   changed and the local copy is unmodified; the delegated GitHub updater
   follows its own stored-tree-SHA policy,
3. commits the clean updates onto the dedicated `coga/skill-update` branch
   and opens (or updates) one draft PR, and
4. appends a `## Skill Update` report to this period task's blackboard,
   bucketing every result emitted by the GitHub, URL, and bundled paths.

Local-edit protection applies to URL-backed skills: a diverged local copy,
provenance conflict, or fetch failure is left untouched and listed under the
report's follow-up heading for a human to resolve.

**A recorded `include` allowlist is not a divergence.** When a URL skill's
`.coga-source.json` carries an `include` list, that names the subset of upstream
this repo installs. The update re-applies it to each fetched archive before the
tree lands, so the pruning is reproduced rather than reported: `source_tree_digest`
stays the true unpruned upstream digest (so upstream-change detection still
works) while `installed_tree_digest` describes the pruned tree on disk. A pruned
skill therefore reads as `unchanged` or `updated`, not as a standing follow-up.
Edits *beyond* the allowlist are still real divergence and still conflict. A
digest recorded before the allowlist was honored is repaired in place on the
next run, and that repair counts as a change so `--pr` commits it. GitHub-backed directories
are upstream-owned by `gh skill update`; when its recorded tree SHA differs
from upstream, re-downloading can overwrite local modifications before the
draft PR is opened. That PR reviews the resulting upstream update; it does not
recover overwritten edits. Do not keep local adaptations in those directories.
Local-backed installs are pinned until an operator reviews their source and
reinstalls explicitly. They currently produce no per-skill update result, so
the weekly report neither lists nor verifies them; omission is not evidence
that their source or installed bytes are current. Hand-vendored directories
have the same unmanaged update posture.
Bundled (package-backed) skills are not touched here — they refresh when the
coga package is upgraded.

A week with no upstream changes is a quiet no-op: nothing is committed and no
PR is opened. A week with only follow-up statuses is intentionally loud: after
writing the `## Skill Update` report, `ticket.py` exits non-zero so this period
task remains visible until a human resolves or parks it.

<!-- coga:blackboard -->

This blackboard persists across every run of this recurring task. Each period
task gets its own blackboard; the `skill-update` run appends its
`## Skill Update` report there, not here. This template keeps no durable state
— every run's output is the skill-update PR and the period task's report.
